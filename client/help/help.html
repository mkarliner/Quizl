# Welcome to Quizzl!
## Basics
Quizzl is a real-time online quiz game for multiple players meant to be played in one room with a real person as the quizmaster.
Contestants get a fixed amount of time to answer questions. 

When a contestant has clicked their answer button they tell the quizmaster the answer, who decides if they have given the correct answer or not, and whether to give them points. 

If they have answered wrong, the quizmaster can resume the timer on the question and allow someone else to answer.

Questions can have multiple clues, which can be shown one at a time. The timer will only start when all the clues have been shown.

For the geeks among you Quizzl is written on a platform called Meteor. 
## Contestants
Playing is simple.
First create an account. You'll be shown the startup screen when you first enter the app.

Next, join a game, you'll see a list of games when you sign in for the first time. Clicking
on a game allows you to join it. You won't be able to play until the quizmaster has started the
game though.

When the game starts you'll be shown the first question, and maybe some clues. Then the countdown
timer will start. You usually have 30 seconds to answer a question. A big green button will appear
that allows you to answer the question. 

When you answer a question, tell the quizmaster what the answer is. 

_Remember: There is nowhere for you answer questions on the app, this is for playing with live people!_


## Quizmasters
### Becoming a quizmaster.
To become a quizmaster, create an account and contact mike@modern-industry.com to be enabled as a quizmaster.

Tip: It's best if the quizmaster uses a laptop or a tablet, as the quizmaster screens are bigger than the contestant screens.
### Creating games and questions
To create a new game, go to the bottom nav bar and click on 'Games'
This will show the new game form. Choose a name for the game and decide if you want people to be able to immediately play the game or to be shown a holding screen(Active/Inactive). Click on save and you will be shown the question editor.

For each question, enter the question, what ever clues you want (if any) and the answer. To enter more than one clue, press the '+' button under the last clue. The list of questions will appear under the form.

When you have finished entering questions, click on the bottom nav 'Games' button, and you will be shown the game list. Clicking on a game allows you to enter it for playing.
### Running games
First make sure you have set your game to 'Active' so people can join it.

When you get to the quizmaster panel, you'll see the name of
your game and the name and scores of all the people who have joined it.
Offline users will show up in grey, online in red.
The top line of buttons do the following:

- Reset - reset the whole game.
- Question - go to the next question
- Clue  - to to the next clue
- Resume - restart the question timer.
- Reveal - reveal the answer

The next line of buttons allows you to add or subtract points from the contenstant who just answered.

_Tip: You can give or take as many points as you feel you want to, just like quiz games on TV..._

The third line of buttons allows you to edit the current game by making a new question or editing the current question.

Note that not all the buttons show at all times, for instance, the 'Clue' button only shows if the question has clues.
